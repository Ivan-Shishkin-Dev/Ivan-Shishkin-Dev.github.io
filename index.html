    <p>
        Hi, I’m Ivan Shishkin — a Computer Science student at UC Irvine driven by building efficient, impactful systems that blend logic, design, and purpose.
        My interests cut across backend development, algorithms, and applied AI — areas I’m exploring through coursework, personal projects, and hands-on experience building real software. From game engines and messaging apps to distributed simulations and databases, I’ve learned how to turn abstract ideas into clean, working systems.
        I’m obsessed with writing code that’s not just functional but durable — scalable, maintainable, and built to last. I work fast, think critically, and value clarity over complexity. My goal is to engineer systems that do more with less — automating, optimizing, and creating real-world impact through code.
