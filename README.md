# Ivan Shishkin - Portfolio

This repository now uses a React + Vite front end to render my portfolio sections (Home, About, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, and Contact) with the original styling and background video preserved.

## Getting started
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Start a local dev server with `npm run dev`.
3. Create a production build with `npm run build`.

Assets such as the background video live under `public/` so they are available at build time.
